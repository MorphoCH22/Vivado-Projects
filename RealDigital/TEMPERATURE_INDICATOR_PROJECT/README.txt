Project: Temperature Indicator
By: MorphoCH22

In this project, I create a SystemVerilog program that simulates a temperature indicator using switches. The indicator activates an LED when it detects a temperature in the range of 62.5 and 72.5 degrees. This project can be programmed into the Xilinx XC7007S ZYNQ, XC7Z007S-1CLG400C using a provided .XDC file, otherwise, a testbench file is available to use for simulation.

Based on Requirement 3 from RealDigital's "Combinational Circuits"
