Project: Two Digit Common Anode SSEG
By: MorphoCH22

In this project, I create a SystemVerilog program that allows a user to control two individual common anode seven segment displays using switches. This project can be programmed into the Xilinx XC7007S ZYNQ, XC7Z007S-1CLG400C using a provided .XDC file.

Based on Challenge 1 from RealDigital's "Structural Verilog for Combinational Systems"
