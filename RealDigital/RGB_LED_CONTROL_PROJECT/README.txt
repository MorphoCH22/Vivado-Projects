Project: RGB LED CONTROL PROJECT
By: MorphoCH22

In this project, I create a SystemVerilog program that allows the user to control an RGB light on a RealDigital Blackboard (Xilinx XC7007S ZYNQ) using three pushbuttons that correspond to each colour and a toggle switch.

Based on challenges 1 and 2 from RealDigital's "Introduction to FPGA Development"
