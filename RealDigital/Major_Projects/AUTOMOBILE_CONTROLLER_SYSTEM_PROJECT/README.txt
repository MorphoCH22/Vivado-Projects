Project: Automobile Controller System
By: MorphoCH22

In this project, I create a SystemVerilog program that functions as a warning system for an automobile that notifies the user of any major or minor problems. I will be implementing this program on a RealDigital Blackboard (Xilinx XC7007S ZYNQ).

Based on challenge 1 from RealDigital's "Logic Circuit Fundamentals"
