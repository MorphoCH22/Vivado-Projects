Project: Shift Registers
By: MorphoCH22

In this project, I create a SystemVerilog program that implements four different shift registers; a PIPO, a PISO, a SIPO, and a Barrel Shifter. This project can be programmed into the Xilinx XC7007S ZYNQ, XC7Z007S-1CLG400C using a provided .XDC file.

Based on Requirements 4-6 and Challenge 1 from RealDigital's "Latches and Flip-Flops"
