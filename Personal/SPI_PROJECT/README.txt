Simple 1 to 4 SPI design, still a work in progress so as of now its just a 1 to 1. Includes sample simulation file that goes over only one testing case for now.

TO-DO:
- Simplify design of "SlaveSPI" module (for example, let "MasterSPI" control counting)
- Create 1 to 4 design
- Create interface with clocking block
- Include randomized testing for different SlaveSPI selections
