/* GOAL: Create a design that takes a clock generated by an FPGA and divides it.
 *
 * Divides 100 MHz clock signal into a 6 MHz clock signal
 *
 * clkIn is the clock created from the Blackboard FPGA, which is 100 MHz
 * clkOut is the slower, divided clock, which is divided to roughly 6 MHz
 *
 * Created by: MorphoCH22
 * Board used: RealDigital Blackboard (Xilinx XC7007S ZYNQ)
